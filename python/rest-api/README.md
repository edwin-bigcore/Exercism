# Rest Api

Implement a RESTful API for tracking IOUs.

Four roommates have a habit of borrowing money from each other frequently, and have trouble remembering who owes whom, and how much.

Your task is to implement a simple [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that receives [IOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU)s as POST requests, and can deliver specified summary information via GET requests.
